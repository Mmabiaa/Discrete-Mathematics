## Logic
- **Logic is known as the science of reasoning**

## Concepts of Logics
- Propositions and Related Concepts
- Quantifiers

## Propositions and Related concepts
- This is any meaningful statement that is either true or false.

In proposition concepts, the **'True'** value is denoted by **'T'** and the **'False'** value is denoted by **'F'**

### Notes

- A **Question** is not a prepositional concept because it is not a statement.
- A **Command** is not a prepositional concept

### Example 1.1

WHich of the following example are propositions? Give the truth values of the propositions.
(a). The difference of two primes.
(b). 2 + 2 = 4
(c). Washington DC is the Capital of New York.
(d). How are you?

### Solution 1.1
(a).**This is 'not a proposition'**
- Reason: This is not a meaningful statement because the two prime numbers are unknown

(b). **This is 'a proposition'.** **The Truth value is 'T'**
- Reason: This is a meaningful statement because 2 + 2 = 4. Hence this is true.

(c). **This is 'a proposition'. The truth value is 'F'**
- Reason: This is a meaningful statement because we know that Washington DC is the capital of USA and not New York. Hence this is false.

(d). **This is 'a not proposition'.**
- Reason: This is a question and not a statement, hence it cannot be a proposition.

### Example 1.2

WHich of the following example are propositions? Give the truth values of the propositions.
(a). 2 + 3 = 7
(b). Julius Cesar was president of the USA
(c). What is the time?
(d). Be quite

### Solution
(a). **This is 'a proposition'. The truth value is 'F'**
- Reason: This is a meaningful statement because we know 2 + 3 is not 7. Hence this is false.

(b).  **This is 'a proposition'. The truth value is 'F'**
- Reason: This is a meaningful statement because we know Julius Cesar was not a US president. Hence this is false.

(c). **This is 'not a proposition'.**
- Reason: This is a question, hence this not a proposition

(d). **This is 'not a proposition'.**
- Reason: This is a command, hence this not a proposition

## Up Next...
- **Compound Propositions or Propositional Functions:** These are obtained from two or more propositions using symbolic connectives.
- **Propositional Variables:** These are used to form prepositional variables

## Compound Propositions
- Conjunction Propositions
- Disjunction Propositions
- Exclusive Disjunction Propositions
- Negation of propositions


### Conjunction Propositions
- **Conjunction:** The conjunction of 'p' and 'q' is denoted by **p ʌ q (p wedge q)**, is the proposition **p 'and' q.**
- This proposition is **True** if and only **if both of the p and q are true**. Otherwise this is **False**.
### Example
```
P = True, Q = True
Truth value = 'T'

p = False, q = True
Truth value = 'F'
```

### Disjunction Preposition
- **Disjunction:** The disjunction of 'p' and 'q' is denoted by **p V q (p vee q)**, is the proposition **p 'or' q.**
- This proposition is **True** if and only **if either p or q is true**. Otherwise, it is **False**.
### Example
```
P = True, Q = True
Truth value = 'T'

p = False, q = True
Truth value = 'T'

p = False, q= 'False'
Truth value = 'F'
```

### Exclusive Disjunction
- **Exclusive Disjunction:** The exclusive disjunction of 'p' and 'q' is denoted by **p ⊕ q**,  is the  proposition **p exclusive or q**.
- This proposition is **True** if and only **if exactly one of the values of p and q is true**. Otherwise, **False**.
### Example
```
P = True, Q = True
Truth value = 'F'

p = False, q = True
Truth value = 'T'

p = False, q= 'False'
Truth value = 'F'
```

### Negation
- **Negation:** The negation of 'p' is denoted by **~p (twiddle p)**.
- This is the opposition of the truth value of p.
### Example
```
Let p = True, ~p = False
```


## Truth Table
- This displays the relationships between truth values of a proposition.
- It shows the input and outputs of propositions
### Example
Construct a table for (p ⊕ q).
### Solution
|p|q|(p ⊕ q)|
|T|T|F|
|T|F|T|
|F|T|T|
|F|F|F|
